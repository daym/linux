Configuration of Reply requests
===============================

The VAN standard specifies a special kind of request, the Reply request.
These are supposed to be answered very quickly.
The reply is either supposed to be in the same frame (!) or deferred
to (a little bit) later.

If you want to listen to Reply requests, you have to set that up, too.
